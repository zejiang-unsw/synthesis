\arguments{
\item{a}{The \emph{a} parameter. Default: 0.2.}

\item{b}{The \emph{b} parameter. Default: 0.2.}

\item{w}{The \emph{w} parameter. Default: 5.7.}

\item{start}{A 3-dimensional numeric vector indicating the starting point for the time series.
Default: c(-2, -10, 0.2).}

\item{time}{The temporal interval at which the system will be generated.
Default: time=seq(0,50,by=0.01) or time = seq(0,by=0.01,length.out = 1000)}

\item{s}{The level of noise, default 0.}
}
\value{
A list with four vectors named \emph{time}, \emph{x}, \emph{y}
and \emph{z} containing the time, the x-components, the
y-components and the z-components of the Rössler system, respectively.
}
\description{
Generates a 3-dimensional time series using the Rossler equations.
}
\details{
The Rössler system is a system of ordinary differential equations defined as:
\deqn{\dot{x} = -(y + z)}{dx/dt = -(y + z)}
\deqn{\dot{y} = x+a \cdot y}{dy/dt = x + a*y}
\deqn{\dot{z} = b + z*(x-w)}{dz/dt = b + z*(x-w)}
The default selection for the system parameters (\emph{a} = 0.2, \emph{b} = 0.2, \emph{w} = 5.7) is known to
produce a deterministic chaotic time series. However, the values a = 0.1, b = 0.1, and c = 14 are more commonly used.
These Rössler equations are simpler than those Lorenz used since only one nonlinear term appears (the product xz in the third equation).

Here, a = b = 0.1 and c changes. The bifurcation diagram reveals that low values of c are periodic,
but quickly become chaotic as c increases. This pattern repeats itself as c increases ---
there are sections of periodicity interspersed with periods of chaos,
and the trend is towards higher-period orbits as c increases.
For example, the period one orbit only appears for values of c around 4
and is never found again in the bifurcation diagram. The same phenomenon is seen with period three;
until c = 12, period three orbits can be found, but thereafter, they do not appear.

\note{
Some initial values may lead to an unstable system that will tend to infinity.
